### `SimpEvalDE/`
Contains the instructions and resources for generating **SimpEvalDE**,  
a *German-specific dataset* for text simplification quality evaluation on which DETECT was trained and evaluated.  
SimpEvalDE includes synthetic scores for **simplicity**, **meaning preservation**,  
and **fluency**, generated by three LLM-based judges.

### `lens/`
Implements:
- **LENS** [[Maddela et al., 2023]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09739)
- **DETECT**, our German-specific adaptation of LENS

Please refer to [`lens/README.md`](lens/README.md) for detailed usage instructions,  
model loading, and scoring examples.
