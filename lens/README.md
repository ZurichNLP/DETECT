 # DETECT ‚Äî Determining Ease and Textual Clarity of German Text Simplifications

**DETECT** is a learned evaluation metric for **automatic text simplification (ATS)** in **German**, extending and improving upon the [LENS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09739) metric.  
It provides **separate scores** for *simplicity*, *meaning preservation*, and *fluency*, as well as a **composite total score**.

## üìò Overview

Current evaluation of German ATS systems often relies on general-purpose metrics such as **SARI**, **BLEU**, and **BERTScore**, which insufficiently capture simplification quality in terms of *simplicity*, *meaning preservation*, and *fluency*.

**DETECT** addresses this limitation by adapting the **LENS** architecture and training methodology to German and extending it with:

- üß© **Synthetic LLM-based supervision:**  
  DETECT is trained entirely on synthetic quality scores generated by large language models (LLMs), removing the need for human annotation.

- üîÅ **LLM-based refinement loop:**  
  A multi-step prompt-refinement procedure aligns LLM grading behavior with simplification quality dimensions.

- üìä **German-specific dataset:**  
  DETECT was validated on the largest German human evaluation dataset for text simplification to date.

Experimental results show that DETECT achieves **significantly higher correlations** with human judgments than widely used ATS metrics‚Äîparticularly strong in *meaning preservation* and *fluency*.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zurich-NLP/DETECT.git
cd DETECT/detect
```
### Python environment (recommended)

```
conda create -n lens_detect python=3.10
conda activate lens_detect
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Scoring in Python

The pretrained DETECT checkpoint is hosted on the ü§ó Hugging Face Hub ‚Üí [ZurichNLP/DETECT](https://huggingface.co/ZurichNLP/DETECT) and is automatically ran when calling the scorer as in:

```from lens.lens.detect_score import DETECT

srcs = [
    "Die komplexe Maschine wurde von den Ingenieuren konzipiert, um den Energieverbrauch zu minimieren."
]

mts = [
    "Die Maschine wurde so gebaut, dass sie weniger Energie verbraucht.",
]

refs = [
    ["Die Ingenieure entwickelten die Maschine, damit sie weniger Energie braucht."]
]

detect = DETECT(rescale=True)
scores = detect.score(srcs, mts, refs, batch_size=8, devices=[0])
print(scores)
```

Example Output:
```
[{'simplicity': 65.86, 'meaning_preservation': 63.57, 'fluency': 61.16, 'total': 64.00}]
```
